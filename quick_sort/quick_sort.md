# Quick Sort



1.The swap function takes two integer pointers as input arguments, and swaps their values.

2.The partition function takes an array arr, and two indices low and high as input arguments.

3.The function selects the last element arr[high] as the pivot element.

4.The function then partitions the array into two parts: one with elements smaller than the pivot, 
  and one with elements greater than the pivot.

5.The function returns the index of the pivot element after partitioning.

6.The quick_sort function takes an array arr, and two indices low and high as input arguments.

7.The function recursively partitions the array and sorts its parts.

8.In the main function, we create an example array arr and pass it to the quick_sort function. 
  We then print the sorted array to the console.
