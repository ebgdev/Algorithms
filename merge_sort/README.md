Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array of elements in ascending or descending order. The algorithm splits the input array into smaller subarrays, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back into a single sorted array.

1.Algorithm Steps
2.Divide the input array into two halves (left and right) using the mid-index.
3.Sort the left half recursively by applying the merge sort algorithm.
4.Sort the right half recursively by applying the merge sort algorithm.
5.Merge the sorted left and right halves to form a single sorted array.
